<p>PyShark is a simple python tool to sniff packets and whois why did i do this? well for example on omegle using wireshark is good however i wanted it to show its whois to make things easier and faster so i did ;)
PyShark may be badly made or not but it does the job i given it ago and it works perfect for me :) enjoy</p>
